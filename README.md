## Prerequisites

### 📚 Dotnet SDK
Ensure your .NET SDK is at least `8.0.400`. Check your version with `dotnet --version`. Update if needed: [Update .NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

### 🎮 Godot
Download and install the [latest Godot 4 C# release](https://godotengine.org/)

### 📦 Repository
To clone the repository along with its submodules, use the following command:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ValksGodotTools/Template
```

Make sure to include the `--recursive` flag to ensure all submodules are also cloned.

### 🛠️ Custom ENet Builds

If you are running on a platform without a build for your platform (such as Apple ARM), you
may need to provide your own build of `ENet-CSharp`. To do so, follow the build instructions
[here](https://github.com/nxrighthere/ENet-CSharp), and place the resulting `ENet-CSharp.dll`
and the `.so` or `.dylib` in the `GodotProject` directory.

## Setup Guide

### 🔧 Configuring your project

Once you have opened `project.godot` located in `Template/GodotProject/project.godot`, make sure all scene tabs are closed. This is very important.

#### Before
![Untitled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61197098-df47-4e0b-a7be-36b97b98f724)

#### After
![Untitled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7be20a1d-2429-43fc-ab76-335b0af5fccf)

#### Press `F5` to run the game

Fill in the required fields and click `Apply`. This will close the game.

![setup-scene](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee2adf8a-56dc-4a6f-9db6-ddb7f74f1e56)

### 🚀 Almost there!

1. Do not save anything if prompted, close the Godot editor entirely
2. Reopen the project and run the new main scene by pressing `F5`
3. If you chose the 3D FPS genre then the 3D FPS scene will load!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you encounter any issues, please refer to the [FAQ](#faq) before creating a new issue

## Scenes

### 3D FPS

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db2dea51-25be-4714-9476-a061135c44ac

> [!NOTE]
> All animations were made by myself from Blender. You are free to use them in your game.

![Untitled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f5395cd-2ac6-46a6-a386-2c665aff98aa)

> [!TIP]
> Tired of strange rotational issues? Quaternions can be your ally! Every `Node3D` has a `.Quaternion` property. Quaternions are combined by multiplication and are always normalized, like `(A * B * C).Normalized()`. Remember, the order in which you multiply quaternions is significant! This technique helped me achieve smooth weapon camera movements.

### 2D Top Down

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62b576fd-eb5d-4f64-9fab-d586312f4e27

## Features
### Multiplayer
The 2D Top Down genre includes a **client-authoritative** multiplayer setup, demonstrating how player positions update on each other's screens. This netcode is the culmination of numerous iterations on multiplayer projects. I've lost count of how many times I've done this.

> [!NOTE]
> `ValksGodotTools/Template` ensures that only the bare minimum data is transmitted, without any unnecessary details like function names. Each packet comes with a small overhead—either 1 or 2 bytes, depending on reliability configured—and a compact one-byte opcode to identify its purpose. Everything else in the packet is strictly the data we need to send.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/964ced37-4a20-4de8-87ee-550fe5ecb561

#### 🌱 First Look at a Client Packet
Below is an example of a client packet. The client uses this packet to inform the server of its position. The `Handle(...)` method is executed on the server thread, so only elements accessible on that thread should be accessed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not directly access properties or methods across threads unless they are explicity marked as thread safe. Not following thread safety will result in random crashes with no errors logged to the console.

```cs
public class CPacketPosition : ClientPacket
{
    [NetSend(1)]
    public Vector2 Position { get; set; }

    public override void Handle(ENetServer s, Peer client)
    {
        // The packet handled server-side (ENet Server thread)
    }
}
```

#### 🌿 First Look at a Server Packet
Below is an example of a server packet. The server uses this packet to inform each client about the position updates of all other clients. The `Handle(...)` method is executed on the client thread, so only elements accessible on that thread should be accessed.
```cs
public class SPacketPlayerPositions : ServerPacket
{
    [NetSend(1)]
    public Dictionary<uint, Vector2> Positions { get; set; }

    public override void Handle(ENetClient client)
    {
        // The packet handled client-side (Godot thread)
    }
}
```

#### 🌷 Net Send Attribute
This client packet sends the username then the position in this order.
```cs
public class CPacketJoin : ClientPacket
{
    [NetSend(1)]
    public string Username { get; set; }

    [NetSend(2)]
    public Vector2 Position { get; set; }

    public override void Handle(ENetClient client)
    {
        // The packet handled client-side (Godot thread)
    }
}
```

#### 🔍 Handling Conditional Logic
Do not use the NetSend attribute if you need to use conditional logic.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A common oversight is using one data type for writing and another for reading. For example, if you have an integer `playerCount` and you write it with `writer.Write(playerCount)`, but then read it as a byte with `playerCount = reader.ReadByte()`, the data will be malformed because `playerCount` wasn't converted to a byte prior to writing. To avoid this, ensure you cast your data to the correct type before writing, even if it feels redundant.

```cs
public class SPacketPlayerJoinLeave : ServerPacket
{
    public uint Id { get; set; }
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public Vector2 Position { get; set; }
    public bool Joined { get; set; }

    public override void Write(PacketWriter writer)
    {
        writer.Write((uint)Id);
        writer.Write((bool)Joined);

        if (Joined)
        {
            writer.Write((string)Username);
            writer.Write((Vector2)Position);
        }
    }

    public override void Read(PacketReader reader)
    {
        Id = reader.ReadUInt();

        Joined = reader.ReadBool();

        if (Joined)
        {
            Username = reader.ReadString();
            Position = reader.ReadVector2();
        }
    }

    public override void Handle(ENetClient client)
    {
        // The packet handled client-side (Godot thread)
    }
}
```

#### 📦 Sending a Packet from the Client
```cs
// Player.cs
Game.Net.Client.Send(new CPacketPosition
{
    Position = Position
});
```

#### 🎁 Sending a Packet from the Server
```cs
Send(new SPacketPlayerPositions
{
    Positions = GetOtherPlayers(pair.Key).ToDictionary(x => x.Key, x => x.Value.Position)
}, Peers[pair.Key]);
```

#### ⛔ Net Exclude Attribute
Using the `[NetExclude]` attribute will exclude properties from being written or read in the network.
```cs
public class PlayerData
{
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public Vector2 Position { get; set; }

    [NetExclude]
    public Vector2 PrevPosition { get; set; }
}
```

### In-Game Debugging

### Menu UI

![main-menu](https://github.com/ValksGodotTools/Template/assets/6277739/e8abf19d-0ac7-4ae3-9942-e1b406edf7cf)
![options](https://github.com/ValksGodotTools/Template/assets/6277739/c5a9e011-f433-4887-8947-36130dd83426)

The majority of UI elements have localisation support for English, French and Japanese.

### Simplified Tweens
Tweening has never been so easy! 🦄
```cs
new GTween(colorRect)
    .SetParallel()
    .Animate("scale", Vector2.One * 2, 2).Elastic()
    .Animate("color", Colors.Green, 2).Sine().EaseIn()
    .Animate("rotation", Mathf.Pi, 2).Elastic().EaseOut();

GTween tween = new GTween(colorRect)
    .SetAnimatingProp("color")
    .AnimateProp(Colors.Red, 0.5).Sine().EaseIn()
    .Parallel().AnimateProp(Colors.Green, 0.5).Sine().EaseOut()
    .Parallel().Animate("scale", Vector2.One * 2, 0.5).Sine()
    .Callback(() => GD.Print("Finished!"))
    .Loop();

tween.Stop();
```

> [!TIP]
> Below is an example of how to run delayed code. Tweens are attached to nodes so if the node gets destroyed so will the tween.
> ```cs
> GTween.Delay(node, seconds, () => callback);
> ```

### Thread Safe Logger
By using `Game.Log()`, you can ensure that your logs are consistent across any thread. This means you won't have to deal with mixed-up logs when logging from the client, server, or Godot threads.

### Fetching Resources
The source generator dynamically generates enums for various resource file paths. These enums are updated upon each project build. This enables efficient and type-safe access to resources within your codebase. Below is a structured overview of the file paths and their corresponding enums:

- **Prefab Resources**:
  - **Search Path**: `**\Prefabs\**\*.tscn`
  - **Associated Enum**: `Prefab`

- **Scene Resources**:
  - **Search Path**: `Scenes\**\*.tscn`
  - **Associated Enum**: `Scene`

**Example Usage**

```cs
// Switching to a specific scene
Game.SwitchScene(Scene.UICredits);
Game.SwitchScene(Prefab.UIOptions);

// Loading a prefab
Game.LoadPrefab<Player>(Prefab.Player);
```

This approach not only enhances readability but also ensures that resource paths are managed consistently and efficiently throughout the project.

### Services
Using the static keyword in `GameServer.cs` for all attributes may initially seem convenient for accessing game server properties across different parts of the code. However, this approach poses significant challenges. When the server restarts or transitions between scenes, static properties retain their values, causing inconsistencies.

Manually resetting each static property to address these issues is cumbersome and error-prone. This demonstrates the need for careful consideration when using static properties, as they can simplify initial development but complicate maintenance and scalability.

In the `_Ready()` method of any node, you can register the node with `Global.Services` by using `Global.Services.Add(this)` (or `Global.Services.Add<Type>` if the script does not extend from Node).

```cs
public partial class UIVignette : ColorRect
{
    public override void _Ready()
    {
        // Set 'persistent' to true if this script is an autoload
        // Scripts that do not extend from Node are persistent by default

        // Non-persistent services are removed just before a scene change
        // Example of a persistent service: AudioManager, which should exist
        // throughout the game's duration

        // This UIVignette is part of the scene, so it should not be persistent
        Global.Services.Add(this, persistent: false);
    }

    public void LightPulse() { ... }
}
```

With this setup, you can now retrieve the instance of `UIVignette` from anywhere in your code without relying on static properties or lengthy `GetNode<T>` paths.

```cs
UIVignette vignette = Global.Services.Get<UIVignette>();
vignette.LightPulse();
```

### Console Commands
Adding the `ConsoleCommand` attribute to any function will register it as a new console command.

> [!NOTE]
> The in-game console can be brought up with `F12`

```cs
[ConsoleCommand("help")]
void Help()
{
    IEnumerable<string> cmds = Game.Console.Commands.Select(x => x.Name);

    Game.Log(cmds.Print());
}
```

Console commands can have aliases, this command has an alias named "exit"
```cs
[ConsoleCommand("quit", "exit")]
void Quit()
{
    GetTree().Root.GetNode<Global>("/root/Global").Quit();
}
```

Most method parameters are supported, allowing for more dynamic interactions
```cs
[ConsoleCommand("debug")]
void Debug(int x, string y)
{
    Game.Log($"Debug {x}, {y}");
}
```

### State Manager
The state manager employs functions as states instead of using classes for state management. The [`State`](https://github.com/ValksGodotTools/GodotUtils/blob/ccd37342ab8d758a664d2abd3375a21b608d2198/State.cs) class is provided in the GodotUtils submodule. Below an example is provided to illustrate this approach.

Create a new file named `Player.cs` and add the following script to it.
```cs
public partial class Player : Entity // This script extends from Entity but it may extend from CharacterBody3D for you
{
    State curState;

    public override void _Ready()
    {
        curState = Idle();
        curState.Enter();
    }

    public override void _PhysicsProcess(double delta)
    {
        curState.Update(delta);
    }

    public void SwitchState(State newState)
    {
        GD.Print($"Switched from {curState} to {newState}"); // Useful for debugging. May be more appealing to just say "Switched to {newState}" instead.

        curState.Exit();
        newState.Enter();
        curState = newState;
    }
}
```
Create another file named `PlayerIdle.cs` and add the following.
```cs
public partial class Player
{
    private State Idle()
    {
        State state = new(nameof(Idle))
        {
            Enter = () =>
            {
                // What happens on entering the idle state?
            },

            Update = delta =>
            {
                // What happens on every frame in the idle state?
            },

            Exit = () =>
            {
                // What happens on exiting the idle state?
            }
        };

        return state;
    }
}
```
Do a similar process when adding new states.

> [!NOTE]
> States have been greatly simplified with the new `EnemyComponent` script. Check out `res://Genres/2D Top Down/Scenes/Prefabs/frog.tscn` to see it in action.

### Extensions

#### Comprehensive Printing
The `.PrintFormatted()` extension method outputs all public properties and fields of any object, including nodes, providing a detailed snapshot of the object's state.

```cs
// Prints results with GD.Print()
node.PrintFormatted();
array.PrintFormatted();

// .ToFormattedString() may be desired if you don't want to use GD.Print()
Game.Log(node.ToFormattedString());
Game.Log(array.ToFormattedString());
```

#### Node Type Search
Recursively searches through the children of a node to find the first instance of a specified type.

```cs
entity.GetNode<Sprite2D>();
```

#### Retrieve Children by Type
Recursively gathers all nodes of a specified type from a given node.

```cs
List<Control> nothingButUINodes = mostlyUINodes.GetChildren<Control>();
```

#### QueueFree Children

### Mod Loader

Mods have the ability to swap out game assets and run C# scripts. You can find an example mod repository [here](https://github.com/ValksGodotTools/ExampleMod).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The mod loader currently cannot handle loading more than one mod with scripts. See https://github.com/ValksGodotTools/Template/issues/15 for more info on this.

## Tips
> [!TIP]
> To run code just before the game exits, you can subscribe to the `OnQuit` event.
> ```cs
> // This is an async function because you way want to await certain processes before the game exists
> Global.Services.Get<Global>().OnQuit += async () =>
> {
>     // Execute your code here
>     await Task.FromResult(1);
> }
> ```

## FAQ
### Q: I'm encountering errors when I first load the project. What should I do?
A: If you're seeing errors on your first project load, it could be because you're offline or didn't clone the submodules. An internet connection is required when running the project for the first time, after that it's not required. To get submodules, use:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If your .NET SDK version is lower than `8.0.400`, the source generator may not create the necessary `Prefab` and `Scene` scripts. Verify your current version by running `dotnet --version` in your terminal. If an update is required, you can download the latest .NET SDK from the following link: [Update .NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

### Q: I'm encountering errors after switching to the `X` genre. What could be the issue?
A: Here are a few common reasons and how to fix them:
  - Make sure you've closed and reopened the Godot editor after changing genres.
  - You may have forgot to close all scene tabs when running the setup script, as a result there may be broken nodepaths. You will have to either manually assign the nodepaths again or download the repository again and start fresh.
  - If you accidentally clicked "Save Changes" on a popup, you will most likely need to download the repository again and start fresh.
  - If you saved a scene that the setup script removed, simply delete that scene, and the console errors should clear up.

> [!TIP]
> If you use [GitHub Desktop App](https://github.com/apps/desktop), you can simply discard all changes made by the setup script instead of completely starting over and downloading the repository again if you run into issues

### Q: The left hand in all the FPS animations is sticking to where the right hand is. How can I fix this?
A: Simply closing and reopening the Godot editor should resolve the issue.
