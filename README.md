# Template
Template to be used for all starting projects.

## Setup
1. Download and install [latest Godot 4 C# release](https://godotengine.org/) *(note that [.NET SDK 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://www.google.com/search?q=.net+framework+4.7.2) are required for Godot C#)*
2. Clone this repository with all its submodules
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ValksGodotTools/Template
```

## Contributing
Please have a look at the [Projects Coding Style](https://github.com/Valks-Games/sankari/wiki/Code-Style).

I highly recommend you install the [GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/). This will almost completely eliminate the need to do Git CLI commands through the command line.

If you are interested in contributing or have any questions please talk to `va#9904` over Discord.
