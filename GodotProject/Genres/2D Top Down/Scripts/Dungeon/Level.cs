                // doing stuff like playerCamera.StartFollowingPlayer(Player); and entities.AddChild(otherPlayer);
                // will need to be done in Net.cs because Level.cs will get reset. Getting the playerCamera
                // and a path to the entities node from Net.cs is miserable. Imagine doing
                // GetTree().Root.GetNode<PlayerCamera>("/root/Level/Camera2D")...
                // Another reason to avoid resetting the entire world is to avoid seeing the lag created
                // from the world reset.
